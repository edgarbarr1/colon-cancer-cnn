# Colon Cancer Image Classification

### Overview ###

Colon cancer has been deemed the number 3 most common cancer in the world, according to the World Cancer Research Fund. Based on this statistic, it is not a surprise to know that more approximately 19 million colonoscopies are perfeormed each year in the United States.

Some experts believe that some of the main causes of this cancer is the Western food diet along with living a sedentary lifestyle as well as being obese. Unfortunately, according to the CDC, the US appears to be on an upward trend in obesity which in turn increases the likelihood of men and women to develop colorectal cancers.

Although the mortality rate for the most part appears to be relatively low (80% survival rate), it is important to note that like everything, there is always something to improve with either accurate test results, the time it takes to report those results and the resources available to compile said results.

Currently, as per the American Cancer Society, it takes 2-3 days to report the findings of a colonoscopy biopsy.

### Objective ###
This notebook has the objective of building a Convolutional Neural Network that can get close to the 1-2% accuracy that current medical tests have. We will also strive to have an efficient model that can give accurate results faster than 2-3 days and ideally within the time frame of "same-day" results.

### The Data ###

The data used for this model is the
